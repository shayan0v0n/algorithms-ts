# What is Linked List?

A linked list is a data structure that stores a sequence of elements called nodes. Each node contains two parts: one part stores the actual data, and the other part points to the next node in the sequence.

The first node in the sequence is called the head, while the last node does not point to any other node (its "next" pointer is null) and is called the tail.

To traverse the linked list, you start at the head and follow the "next" pointers until you reach the tail. The advantage of using a linked list over an array is that you can insert or delete elements from the list without needing to shift all the other elements to make space for the new or removed element.
