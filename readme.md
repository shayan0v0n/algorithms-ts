# How To Execute Algorithms

as we using typescript you have to use bun or deno for execute algorithms,
you can install bun as global runtime

<pre>
<code>
    npm run install:bun
</code>
</pre>

and then run the example using bun,

<pre>
<code>
    bun run ./algorithm-dir/app.ts
</code>
</pre>

i hope you enjoy:)
