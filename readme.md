# How To Execute Algorithms

you have to use node.js for execute algorithms,
then you have to follow this way for execution algorithms

1.first of all you have to install all project dependencies

<pre>
<code>
    npm install
</code>
</pre>
<br />
<br />

2.finally you can execute algorithms like this

<pre>
<code>
    npm run start:<algorithm_name>
</code>
</pre>

<br />

we have algorithms like linkedList & Tree...

i hope you enjoy:)
