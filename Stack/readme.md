A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates where you can only add or remove a plate from the top.

The two main operations associated with a stack are:

Push: Adding an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removing the element from the top of the stack.
You can visualize a stack as a collection of elements with two main operations:

Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
These operations occur at the same end, traditionally referred to as the "top" of the stack. New elements are added above the existing elements, and elements are removed from the same top position.

Stacks are used in various algorithms and applications, such as parsing expressions, tracking function calls in a program, managing function execution contexts, and implementing undo mechanisms in software applications. They are a fundamental concept in computer science and have applications in both theoretical and practical aspects of programming.
